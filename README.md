# Sound Level Mesh System

A distributed sound monitoring system consisting of 10 ESP32-based WiFi sensor devices that communicate with a central web server to monitor, analyze, and report sound levels and frequency band measurements.

## 📋 Project Status

**Current Phase: Design and Planning**

This project is currently in the **design and planning phase**. All system requirements, architecture, and hardware specifications have been documented, but **no code has been generated yet**.

### What's Complete
- ✅ Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- ✅ System Architecture Document
- ✅ Hardware Design Document
- ✅ Technical specifications and design decisions

### What's Next
- ⏳ ESP32 firmware development (ESP-IDF)
- ⏳ Backend API server development
- ⏳ Frontend web application development
- ⏳ Hardware assembly and testing
- ⏳ System integration and deployment

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Sound Level Mesh System is designed to:

- Monitor sound levels (dB) in real-time from 10 distributed sensor locations
- Measure sound levels across configurable frequency bands
- Provide centralized web-based monitoring and administration
- Support sensor calibration with dB offset adjustments
- Store measurement data using file-based storage (JSON/CSV)
- Deploy on Ubuntu 20.04 server with Nginx
